The Symphony Hack show consisted of a series of musical pieces that were performed 
by the orchestra plus tech that was meant to add to the human experience. It was 
geared towards children and education. For example, they played a piece by Messiaen
wherein they included a couple of large cubes that lit up with various colours when
the orchestra played. This was meant to be an example of synesthesia. Messiaen had
synesthesia and this sensory condition was really important in his creative output.
They also showed us the theramin.
Another interesting peice of tech they used was an app called Aumi, which is allowes
people with limited movement to also play music. The app pickes up the slightest 
movements which triggers sound in the app. They showcased the app by "air violin-ing"
(mimicking movements of playing the violin without actually making sound) a piece.
The man playing the lead part for the violin was named Adrian Anantawan and he was
born without a hand. He found ways to play the violin despite his missing limb. 

It was not only tech though. They asked the audience to cover their ears to hear a 
Beethoven piece to "experience his deafness" in a way...they also had a women come 
on who played percussion on a bicycle. A percussion trio played on garbage. These 
were meant to show kids that anything can be an instrument.

Before the concert was the maker faire. Here, parents and children (and whoever 
went) could walk around and interact with different kids of new inventions. I saw
a laser harp, that when you put your hand in front of the laser it would detect 
that its light beam was interrupted and would make a sound as a result. There was 
a cardboard electric guitar. There was also a man that played an electric saxophone
(an instrument that detected your air stream and responded to it, making sound 
through a midi machine). The man also had coding software open which was allowing 
music to play minecraft.
