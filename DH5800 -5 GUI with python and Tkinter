Robert volunteered to run this "how to" session for students which was incredibly
educational. It was all simple but great for me as a beginner programmer. I found 
it pleasurable and relaxing to write code. He explained things in a simple and quick
way that helped me understand concepts easily. It inspired me to do more...though I'd
have to take my desktop out of it's dusty box. My laptops are mediocre...I brought my
laptop which had to update for almost 20min then didn't want to connect to the internet
so I could upload python...I tried to use online python coding websites...but they 
couldn't download/identify tkinter.
I ended up using a spare laptop Robert had.
As frustrating as the morning was, the rest of the session was uplifting. I think I will
try configuring my chromebook (which has some storage space) and do coding on it. Maybe 
this would be an opportunity to learn linux.
Robert and I spoke about laptops vs desktops and how his students function on each.
He says he has to do some "marriage concelling" for group projects because some people
are used to working on laptops (where they can meet on campus or anywhere else) while others
are more comfortable working on their desktops at home. 

Below are some codes I made (and they worked!):


from tkinter import *
from tkinter import messagebox
from tkinter import simpledialog

def greet():
    ans=simpledialog.askstring("Input","What is your name?")
    messagebox.showinfo("Greet","Hello "+ ans)
    ans=simpledialog.askinteger("Input","What is your age?",
                            minvalue=0, maxvalue=100)
    
root=Tk()
Greetbutton=Button(text="hi",command=greet)

Greetbutton.grid()
root.mainloop()

from tkinter import *

root = Tk()

l = Label(text="Welcome!")
cupic = PhotoImage(file="falcon.gif")
p = Label(image=cupic)

def doit():
    messagebox.showinfo(message="Scale is "+ str(s.get()))
b = Button(text='Press Me', command=doit)

q = Button(text="Quit", command=exit)
s = Scale(from_=0, to=100, orient=HORIZONTAL,length=200)

def switchblue():
    root.configure(bg="blue")
def switchpink():
    root.configure(bg="pink")

r12 = IntVar()

r1 = Radiobutton(text="Blue", variable=r12,value=1,command=switchblue)
r2 = Radiobutton(text="Pink", variable=r12,value=2,command=switchpink)

p.grid(row=0,column=0); l.grid(row=0,column=1)
b.grid(row=1,column=0); q.grid(row=1,column=1)
r1.grid(row=1,column=2); r2.grid(row=1,column=3)
s.grid(row=3,columnspan=4)

root.mainloop()
