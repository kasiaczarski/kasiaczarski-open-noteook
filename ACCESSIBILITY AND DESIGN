Disabilties are definitly not talked about very often in the context of large classes. Most material is offered from a textbook and 
I can't imagine many texbooks having brail (in the case of paperback)...and I've tried online readers and inputing text from pdf was rather
challenging  (maybe that's just me though). How often do deaf people find themselves in a music class..that's an interesting question to 
me. How do you teavch deaf people music if they'd like to learn about, let's say, issues in poplar culture (a course offered at Carleton)?

An important thing for me while I was reading was that accessibility effects everyone, not just people with disabilities or access issues.
This makes me think about how racism against Indiginous or Black people is not only their problem. It's a problem all people in the world
are reponsible for/part of.   

A comment that struck me was about how new tech is or is not offering new accessibility. I made a comment in return about a blind man who
would come into where I used to work. He used voice control on his smart phone which worked well however he did seem to require to do
some touch screen stuff. This didn't go so well...My question is, are touch screens accessible to all (consider those individuals with 
huge fingers like my uncle!!) or perhaps could buttons still be taken further by incorporating brail or being a bit larger?

To link more to this (specifically tech on a global level in terms of popularity), accessibility would benefit retail stores which do have
a lot of control over what people come into contact with. Promoting this in the indefinite abyss of consumerism could introduce 
accessibility into the norm.
