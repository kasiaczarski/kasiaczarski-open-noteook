Disabilties are definitly not talked about very often in the context of large classes. Most material is offered from a textbook and 
I can't imagine many texbooks having brail (in the case of paperback)...and I've tried online readers and inputing text from pdf was rather
challenging  (maybe that's just me though). How often do deaf people find themselves in a music class..that's an interesting question to 
me. How do you teavch deaf people music if they'd like to learn about, let's say, issues in poplar culture (a course offered at Carleton)?

An important thing for me while I was reading was that accessibility effects everyone, not just people with disabilities or access issues.
This makes me think about how racism against Indiginous or Black people is not only their problem. It's a problem all people in the world
are reponsible for/part of.
